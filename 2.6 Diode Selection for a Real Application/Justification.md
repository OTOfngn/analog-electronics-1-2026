Voltage Rating (12V): Its nominal 12V (±5%) clamping is ideal for protecting 12V logic or supply rails.

Current/Power (250mW): Its 250mW power rating is suitable for low-power protection tasks when used with a proper current-limiting resistor.

Cost & Availability: It's an industry-standard, low-cost (¢) part from multiple suppliers (e.g., Nexperia, ON Semi), making it perfect for prototyping and volume use.

In summary, it offers a solid balance of specified performance, reliability, and cost for general-purpose voltage clamping.
